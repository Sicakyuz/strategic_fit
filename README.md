## Introduction

The **Advanced Supply Chain Strategy Simulation** is an interactive web application designed to help students understand key concepts in supply chain management, including strategic fit, responsiveness, efficiency, and the impact of external challenges. Built using Streamlit, this simulation provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the trade-offs between various supply chain factors.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to serve as an educational tool for students studying supply chain management or related fields. By simulating different scenarios and adjusting key parameters, students can observe how strategic decisions impact overall supply chain performance.

## Features

- **Company Selection**: Simulate supply chain strategies for well-known companies like Amazon, Netflix, IKEA, and Wayfair.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Modify costs, lead times, demand uncertainty, sustainability, and risk factors.
- **External Challenges**: Introduce external factors such as supply chain disruptions and global demand shifts.
- **Performance Index**: Calculate a performance index based on strategic fit and responsiveness.
- **Visualizations**: Generate charts to visualize cost breakdowns.
- **Assignment Questions**: Answer detailed questions to deepen understanding and analysis.
- **Simulation Report**: Download a comprehensive report containing simulation data and assignment responses.

## Disclaimer

**Educational Purposes Only**: The metrics and scenarios used in this simulation are illustrative and not based on actual data from the companies mentioned. They are simplified representations intended to facilitate learning and do not reflect the real-world operations or financials of these companies.
